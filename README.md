### `Auth Credentials`

Add API_KEY to your own config.json file, as I don't include it in my commits

### `Would Have Been Nice's`

- [ ] With my implementation, it would be ideal to not update the total photos state when updating each pictureâ€™s photographer;s name
- [ ] Request a change to the endpoint to include the metadata needed to explain in the same one we request images (API would return the photographer name rather than id)
- [ ] Would spend more time making grid gutters and card widths to better fit break points
- [ ] Add logic for showing favorited items
- [ ] Would have liked showing a modal with full-sized photo when clicking on title
- [ ] Could have avoided inline styling if I had time to set up css modules
